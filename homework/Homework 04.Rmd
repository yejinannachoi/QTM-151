**Q1**: (10 points) For the dataset `flu`, make a map to show the distribution of the peak number of flu cases at each state in one year of your choice.


```{r}
flu <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/qtm151/main/datasets/flu.csv')
head(flu, 2)

states <- map_data("state")
flu <- left_join(flu, states, by = "region")

flu %>%
  filter(year.Date. == 2010) %>%
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, fill = peak, group = group)) + 
  geom_polygon(color = NA) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  scale_fill_gradient(high = "red", low = "white") +
  ggtitle("2010 Flu Distribution in the United States") +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", fill = "Peak Number of Flu Cases")
```
